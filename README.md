# SaaS Log Analytics Product with ClickHouse – Architecture & Implementation

## Overview

This document captures the plan and architectural design for building a SaaS-style log analytics and observability product using **ClickHouse** as the backend database. It includes the rationale, implementation plan, and best practices for isolating customer data in a multi-tenant model.

---

## Goals of the Product

* Provide **real-time log analytics** for enterprise applications.
* Enable **multi-tenant** usage with data isolation.
* Support **scalable ingestion, querying, and visualization** of logs.
* Deliver the product as a **self-hostable Helm chart** (Kubernetes friendly).
* Implement **licensing and usage control**.

---

## Why ClickHouse?

ClickHouse is a high-performance columnar OLAP database designed for analytical workloads and large-scale time-series data.

### Key Benefits:

* Fast ingestion of logs at scale
* Real-time analytics with low-latency queries
* Columnar storage with compression
* MergeTree engine for efficient range and aggregation queries
* Easy integration with Kafka, REST, and HTTP clients

---

## Multi-Tenant Design Options

### Option 1: One Database per Tenant (Best Practice)

```sql
CREATE DATABASE company_amazon;
CREATE TABLE company_amazon.logs (...);
```

**Pros:**

* Strong tenant isolation
* Easy backups, deletions, and scaling per company
* Prevents accidental query leaks

**Cons:**

* Slightly more infra overhead if scaling to thousands of tenants (manageable with automation)

### Option 2: One Table per Tenant

```sql
CREATE TABLE logs_amazon (...);
```

**Cons:**

* Clutters schema namespace
* Harder to manage

### Option 3: Shared Table with Tenant ID (Soft Isolation)

```sql
CREATE TABLE logs (
  tenant_id String,
  timestamp DateTime,
  level String,
  message String
) ENGINE = MergeTree() ORDER BY (tenant_id, timestamp);
```

**Cons:**

* Requires strict row-level access control in app layer
* Riskier from a data leakage perspective

**✅ Recommended: Option 1 – One Database per Company**

## Proposed Architecture

```
[User/SDK/API]
      |
      v
[Backend Service Layer] -- [License & Usage Control]
      |
      +--> [Kafka Queue] ---> [ClickHouse Ingestor Service]
      |                          |
      |                          +--> [ClickHouse: company_db.logs]
      |
      +--> [PostgreSQL for metadata & config]
```

---

## Backend Capabilities

* Tenant onboarding: create DB + schema
* Token generation & license enforcement
* Log ingestion endpoint
* REST/GraphQL API for querying logs
* Usage monitoring and limits

---

## Delivering as a Product

* Package as a **Helm chart** for easy K8s installation
* Use **API keys** for authentication
* Usage metering for billing/alerts
* Kill switch if license is invalid or exceeded

---

## SDK or Agent Design

* SDK or sidecar collects logs from client applications
* Sends them to your ingestion API
* API routes them to correct tenant's ClickHouse database

---

## Future Enhancements

* Add dashboarding (Grafana or custom)
* Enable alerting/threshold notifications
* Use ClickHouse clusters for HA & sharding
* Cold storage tier with S3 for archival

---

## Takeaway Points

* ClickHouse is ideal for high-volume log analytics
* One DB per tenant ensures clean and scalable multi-tenancy
* You control everything: data, licensing, UI, and deployment
* Can be self-hosted or cloud-based SaaS
* Helm-based delivery enables seamless client setup
* Your backend becomes the gatekeeper of usage, licensing, and isolation
